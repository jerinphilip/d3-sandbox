So, whenever there is need for a visualization of sorts, I feel the
easiest way to create it at the moment is d3. While writing a conference
paper, I had to draw a tree, which was straightforward to an extend. I
glued together an example of force-layout-tree with the data I was
required to visualize, and got decent results.

A month or so down, I was having trouble finding an aesthetically and
functionally superior representation for another data I had to visualize
and present in the same paper. This time I went through the gallery and
decided a [collapsible indented
tree](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1093025) will be good fit. After
finishing the required tweaking, with minimal knowledge of the framework
- I'm fan enough to go ahead and dive in. So, here goes.
